feat: Complete plugin auto-installation in install script

BREAKING CHANGE: Install script now performs full plugin setup automatically

## What's New âœ¨
- **Complete Plugin Installation**: Automatically clones, builds, and installs the Obsidian plugin
- **TypeScript Build**: Runs `npm install` and `npm run build` to generate main.js
- **Prerequisites Check**: Validates Git, Node.js, and npm before starting
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux with proper script detection

## Technical Improvements ðŸ”§
- Auto-creates `.obsidian/plugins/longneobsidian-vault-sync/` directory
- Downloads and builds plugin from source with all dependencies
- Installs sync scripts to vault root for plugin detection
- Comprehensive error handling and status reporting
- Enhanced .gitignore with plugin development files

## User Experience ðŸ“ˆ
- **One-Command Setup**: Single script now handles everything automatically
- **Zero Manual Steps**: No more manual GitHub cloning or npm building
- **Complete Validation**: Tests plugin files, scripts, and execution
- **Clear Instructions**: Detailed next steps for Obsidian plugin activation

## Before vs After
**Before**: Install script + manual plugin clone + manual build + manual setup
**After**: Single `bash <(curl -s URL)` command handles everything

## Benefits
- Eliminates user confusion about missing plugin directory
- Ensures proper TypeScript compilation for all users  
- Reduces support requests for incomplete installations
- Provides consistent cross-platform experience

This resolves the core issue where users had sync scripts but missing plugin structure.
Users now get a complete, working plugin installation in one command.

Ready for immediate deployment to improve user onboarding experience.
