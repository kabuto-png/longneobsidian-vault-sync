fix: Revert installer to only handle scripts, not plugin installation

- Remove plugin installation logic from installer script
- Installer now only downloads and places sync scripts in vault root
- Preserve existing plugin installations instead of overriding them
- Remove incorrectly generated manifest.json and main.js files
- Update installer to detect existing plugin and provide guidance
- Focus installer on script setup only, plugin should be installed separately

The installer was incorrectly trying to create plugin files, but the actual
plugin is a full TypeScript project with build system, dependencies, and
complex structure that cannot be simple-installed via curl.

Correct workflow:
1. Use installer to setup sync scripts in vault root
2. Install plugin separately via Obsidian Community Plugins or manual install
3. Plugin automatically detects scripts in vault root

This respects the existing plugin architecture and avoids conflicts with
proper plugin installations.
